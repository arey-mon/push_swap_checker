RESOLVE
5 <= 12 moves
100 = <700 moves
500 = <5300 moves

TESTINGS
1. make a lot of testings with instructions
2. make a lot of tests involving operations and size
3. value = 0

ISSUES
? program should not quit before all instructions are read,
. if there is a '0' in args, it is not printed (but not an error)
. Stock B is not initialized. cf a.out >> rr
. program contains some exit(1), but it impeaches free
. norme
. integers_check_error is false if a number size is = 10 and above min or max, it returns error when shouldn't
. writing 2- as arg works...
