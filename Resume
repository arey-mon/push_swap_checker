In subject, it is said pgm will be used like this : 
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
so checker can print OK or KO if stack is sorted

It will also be tested like this :
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l

. have to check_leaks again with 
rr          lots of spaces
lots of spaces            pa
Are we supposed to print Error or should it work ??
if we are supposed to print an error I can change ret = read == 1 in instructions
