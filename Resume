RESOLVE
5 <= 12 moves
100 = <700 moves
500 = <5300 moves

TESTINGS
1. make a lot of testings with instructions
	change characters length to see if all is ok (ex : pa/rrr/rrbc/pac...)
2. make a lot of tests involving operations and size
3. value = 0
4. size of arr = 1 || = 2

ISSUES
? program should not quit before all instructions are read,
	!! even if instruction is wrong !
	Not so sure...
. if you have "2m" in stdin, it works. Thats is WRONG
. if there is a '0' in args, it is not printed (but not an error)
. if arg is '-' no error, also with '-a'
. Stock B is not initialized. cf a.out >> rr
. program contains some exit(1), but it impeaches free
. resolve malloc
. Makefile
. norme

QUESTIONS
should we return ok
- if !stacka and stackbordered
- if both stack ordered 
?
